# Python
This is my python user code for automating various tasks<br><br>

## Audio Metadata Analyzer V0.1
This is my first Python program, written to learn the basics of object-oriented programming in Python, as well as to manage my library of audio files. First of all, for searching audio files and filtering according to various parameters, but also, in the future, for creating playlists and searching for new files on the Internet<br><br>
To run, use audio_track_app.bat, just install first all the libraries that the app uses, such as **mutagen**.<br><br>
Now the interface looks like this:<br>

![Example](Audio%20Metadata%20Analyzer.jpg)<br><br>
To use, enter the path to the folder with audio files (mp3 and flac), and click the button "read folder content"<br><br>
When the audio files are found - you can filter the results using the "apply filter" button, pre-enter the filter parameters, such as year and/or artist.
